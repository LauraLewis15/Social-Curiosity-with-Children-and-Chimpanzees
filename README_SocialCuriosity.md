# Chimpanzees and children are more curious about social interactions than individual actions

## Description of the data and file structure

To test whether chimpanzees and children are curious about social interactions and whether social information is rewarding, we designed a simple setup using two “Curiosity Boxes”. A tablet was placed inside each box, which allowed the experimenter to simultaneously present participants with two different videos. In Experiment 1, participants were presented with a video of social interactions between conspecifics in one box, and a video of a conspecific acting alone in the other box. In Experiment 2, participants were presented with a reward-dispenser that periodically dispensed rewards (marbles for children, and jackfruit seeds for chimpanzees) in one box, and a video of a social interaction in the other box. In Experiment 3, participants were presented with videos of positive social interactions (like playing and grooming) in one box, and videos of negative social interactions (like conflict) in the other box. Participants were given a short amount of time to explore both boxes, and we recorded the length of time that they spent watching each video or collecting the rewards. We also measured the maximum height that children raised the box doors.
